- 👋 Hi, I’m @tiroger
- 👀 I'm a Neuroscientist, Machine Learning enthusiast and avid cyclist. I care about things like statistical significance and reproducibility. I am no graphic artist, but I like to draw stuff, make pretty graphs and presentations, and mess with colors and line widths.
- 🌱 Learning is what drives me — I believe that there is always room for improvement, especially with regards to my own abilities, and I constantly seek to sharpen my skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any competition.
- 📫 Drop me a line roger@cyclingscientist.com
